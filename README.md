# TL Project 8
An app for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup," a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need an intelligent way for employees to share contact information.
By using a random user generator API https://randomuser.me/ the application grabs information for 12 random 'employees' and use that data to build a prototype for an awesome startup employee directory.
